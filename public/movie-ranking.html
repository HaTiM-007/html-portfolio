<h1>Best Movies According To Sandeep</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>INTERSTELLAR</h3>
<P>Directed by the great Christopher Nolan.One of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time, featuring a great cast including Mathew McConaughey,Jessica Chastain and anne hathaway in the lead.The story revolves around-a goup of astronauts trying to look for a new home as Earth is going to get uninhabitable soon.The ending is just amazing.</P>
<h3>THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY</h3>
<p>Yet another classic but this one belongs to the western genre of cinema. It's directed by the great Sergio Leone.Do give it a try.</p>
<h3>DRIVE</h3>
<p>Directed by Nicolas Wending.It's visually pleasing to watch and the first thirty minutes of the movie is bound to get you hyped up.The movie features Ryan Gosling as the lead, a character with no name but everyone calls him 'driver' in this movie. He is...kind and that is why he is STRONG, he expects nothing from anyone.</p>
